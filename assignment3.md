Taylor Swift has put out six albums across both country and pop music platforms. All of her albums have garnered awards to a degree, some more than others, and her world tours are among the hottest concerts to attend. So I wonder, with the amount of Grammy nominations she has earned over the years and the number or cities she has expanded to (or pulled away from) on her tours, is there a correlation between how many cities Swift visits on her world tour and the number of Grammys she wins from that album? This is the data I will be collecting:

1) The six studio albums of Taylor Swift.

2) The number of overall stops on each tour.

3) The number of American cities visited while on tour.

4) The number of overseas cities visited while on tour.

5) The number of Grammy nominations earned from each album.

6) Whether the album won Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.

7) Whether a lead single from the album won Song of the Year at the Grammy Awards.



Album | Overall tour stops | U.S. stops | Overseas stops| Grammy nominations | AOTY Winner? | SOTY Winner?
---- | ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------
Taylor Swift|No Tour|No Tour|No Tour|1|No|No
Fearless|118|104|14|8|Yes|Yes
Speak Now|110|79|31|3|No|No
Red|86|66|20|4|No|No
1989|85|63|22|10|Yes|No
Reputation|51|40|11|TBD|TBD|TBD

I will collect the data from past tour schedules to see how many stops were in the U.S. compared to overseas. I will collect nominations and wins from Swift's various records and albums from records from the Recording Academy.
