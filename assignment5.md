![NewYorkchart](https://github.com/kevinschmidt2018/digitalframeworks/blob/master/NewYorkchart.png)

The dataset represents the number of deaths in New York City among white, non-Hispanic males in 2014. The data was pulled from the City of New York database, NYC Open Data, for the dataset “New York City Leading Causes of Death: The leading causes of death by sex and ethnicity in New York City in since 2007.” The data from this particular set of NYC Open Data was from Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) in New York City 

It is important to note that the data point “All Other Causes” is inclusive of several other causes, below the minimum data point of “High Blood Pressure,” although the sum of these causes equal 2,275 fatalities. It is also important to note that “Fatal Accidents” does not include accidental overdoses. 

The dataset is informative, but leaves more questions that answers regarding death rates of New Yorkers as a whole? What are the highest causes of death among minority men in the city, and how does that correlate with the overall number of deaths among minority men? With health-related issues being the highest causes of deaths among the selected demographic, how have the causes of death fluctuated over recent years in relation with advancments in the healthcare industry? 

Of course, with "All Other Causes" being the third-highest cause of death, what are the cause that comprise this category?  Homocides and accidental overdoses are not included in the chart, yet crime and death records will show that there are residents in the selected demographic that have died due to these causes. This data would be a good subset to compliment the original graph.
