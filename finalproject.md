Between 1904 and 2004, Missouri voted for the winning candidate in every presidential election, with the exception of once. The Show-Me State, along with its 10 electoral votes, had long been considered a battleground comparable to Ohio or Michigan, but recent election cycles have shown a steady shift toward solid red. It started with President Obama’s razor thin 2008 loss in the state and, most recently, a Trump victory over Hillary Clinton by nearly 19 percentage points in 2016. Now, the trend is working against Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who is running for her third term this year and is one of 10 Democrats defending Senate seats in states won by President Trump.

Since the 2016 presidential election, Missouri held five special elections in 2017 and four in 2018, all for either State House of State Senate seats. The results of nearly every election show a common trend in the state, some more exaggerated than others: Republicans saw a significant uptick in margins of victory (MOV) between the 2012 and 2016 elections, and a decrease, some to the point of loss altogether, in nearly every county participating in special elections since Trump took office. Based on outcomes from recent special elections in Missouri, which parts of the state can McCaskill focus her campaign toward to better ensure a victory in November?

In order to find this out, data was collected from the [Missouri Secretary of State](http://enrarchives.sos.mo.gov/enrnet/default.aspx) to identify political trends in select counties in Missouri, and which areas have either shifted or remained steady over the years. The sets and charts are composed of data from the 2012 and 2016 general elections, and the nine special elections in the state in 2017 and 2018. The data is broken down by comparing the margin of victories in select counties that were part of State House or State Senate districts that participated in a special election, and how the results compare to 2012 and 2016 outcomes. 

It Is important to note that, while some districts are composed of multiple counties, counties can also be divided into two or more State House or State Senate districts. Therefore, counties in districts with the most dramatic changes were scrutinized by collecting data from the district as a whole and better determine whether a consistent political trend occurred in a particular region of the state, or simply in a select portion of a particular county.

According to [270towin.com](https://www.270towin.com/2018-senate-polls/missouri/), which lists all recent polling in Senate races nationwide, Senator McCaskill leads her opponent, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, by a few percentage points. Based on election analysis and voter turnout trends, McCaskill has an opportunity—rather, an obligation—to attract more Missouri voters in select rural and suburban counties that have experienced fluctuations in political preferences since her 2012 Senate campaign. 

### Rural Risk

Rural areas that could be a worthwhile focus for McCaskill lie in Iron and Reynolds counties in Missouri House District 144, and Chariton and Ray counties in Missouri House District 39.

In District 144, McCaskill won in Iron County in 2012 by nearly 20 percentage points, although the county went for Trump by more than 50 percentage points in 2016. The GOP candidate won the district in 2018, but Iron County saw a massive democratic shift by a nearly 23-percent margin of victory. 

Reynolds County, also in State House District 144 and won by Trump in 2016, saw a dramatic 54 percent drop in GOP margin of victory in the 2018 special election. In the most recent midterm election 2014, 1,603 votes were cast in Reynolds County, of the 5,008 registered voters at the time. 

Chariton and Ray counties in State House District 39 had similar trends: won by McCaskill in 2012 but claimed by Romney the same year and saw a large loss in margin of victory from the GOP candidate in the special election since Trump’s sweeping victory in the area. It is important to note the GOP candidate for state representative won by a larger margin in 2018 compared to 2012, so a trend toward blue is not necessarily apparent here. However, 

### Suburban Strategy

Jefferson County, a St. Louis suburb in State House District 97, and Jackson County, a Kansas City suburb in State Senate District 8, are vulnerable counties with larger populations and wavering political preferences. 

In recent elections, Kansas City votes strongly democratic, but its immediate surrounding counties tend to go the other way. In the city, McCaskill won by 66 percent in the 2012 election and President Obama won by nearly 56 percent; Hillary Clinton also won by a wide margin in 2016, and the Democrat in the city’s special election in 2017 won by a whopping 79 percent margin. McCaskill also won Jackson County in 2012, although it went for both Trump in 2016. State Senate District 8, which is comprised exclusively of the Kansas City suburban county, leaned toward the GOP candidate in 2017 by a narrow eight percent margin. But previous elections in the same race – the Republican candidate won by a nearly 60 percent margin in 2010 and had no opponent in 2014 – show that the county may be shifting toward the center. And because Jackson County is Missouri’s second most populous and where McCaskill began her political career, this should be necessary focus over the next six months. 

In the St. Louis metropolitan area, State House District 97, which is comprised of portions of St. Louis and Jefferson Counties, is a key focal point for McCaskill. Jefferson County, which is the state’s sixth-most populous county, was won by Trump in 2016, although its district as a whole flipped in 2018 with a narrow victory by a Democrat. Because of such a democratic shift among a large number of voters, Jefferson County could give her a significant boost. 

### Hometown Hope

McCaskill grew up in various small towns in the state but she ended up in Columbia, a college town where she attended high school and the University of Missouri. Columbia is a part of Boone County, located in the middle of the state and part of State House District 50. While the district does not include the portion of the county that the city of Columbia is in, it does include Columbia’s more rural suburbs and areas surrounding the state capital, Jefferson City. 

An uncontested Republican has won the State House seat in District 50 for the past three elections, so seeing a 6.2 percent victory by a Democrat in Boone County during the 2017 special election is significant—even though the district as a whole went for the GOP candidate. In fact, it could be seen that the county is leaning further left, considering Clinton won by a wider margin that Obama in the county in 2016. And with more than 41,000 votes cast in the county in the 2014 midterm election, a hometown pivot would be a smart move for McCaskill this year. 

![VoterInfo](https://github.com/kevinschmidt2018/digitalframeworks/blob/master/VoterInfo.png)

McCaskill won in 2006 by defeating an incumbent senator, and narrowly achieved victory in 2012 with much thanks to her Republican opponent, then-Congressman Todd Akin, for coining the term “legitimate rape” during a television interview just two months before the election. She won by nearly 16 percent, or roughly 428,000 votes. But midterm elections are notorious for low turnout, as seen in the chart above representing the 2014 election. The data, collected from the Missouri Secretary of State, shows an overall 4.1 million registered voters in 2014 with 1.4 million votes cast -- about a 35 percent voter turnout.  If a similar rate were to occur in 2018, a 1 percent difference between McCaskill and her opponent would approximate to roughly 14,000 votes. Given the volatility of some of these areas, the number of registered votes in these counties and the toss-up nature of the race, capitalizing on political trends in these counties could ensure a McCaskill victory this fall. 

The data is not intended as a campaign strategy, but rather a suggestion to the candidate and provide a better insight to residents of the counties, districts and state.
