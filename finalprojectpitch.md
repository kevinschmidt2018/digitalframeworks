Final Data Project Pitch 

Kevin Schmidt

Missouri Midterms: I have begun building datasets based on the results of both the 2016 presidential election and five special elections in Missouri in 2017. Then, I calculated victory margin percentages to compare the differences between the two election results. The source is the Missouri Secretary of Stateâ€™s website, http://enrarchives.sos.mo.gov/enrnet/default.aspx.

My interesting question I want to answer with the data is whether these Missouri counties that participated in special elections in 2017 shifted politically from 2016, and what such a change would mean for politicians (Sen. Claire McCaskill, in particular) running this fall. I would want to determine which parts of the state would be most useful for Democrats and Republicans to focus their attention on in 2018, and which parts are seeing the most biggest political shifts. Beyond the data that I have collected, I would like to include preliminary Midterms polling in the state, and possibly include some sort of a link to a piece of demographic data (change in voter registration rate, change in population, change in median household income, etc) to determine whether this is a continuous trend, and why or why not.
