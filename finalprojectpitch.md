"To Do, Or Not To Do"

In a nation where the marriage rate continues to decline, how has the 2015 Supreme Court ruling changed the overall types of couples being married today. And as past Censuses have consistently recorded errors of same-sex marriages, how the inclusion of clearer language regarding relationships in the 2020 Census affect overall marriage demographics nationwide?

According to a 2017 Pew Research analysis, about half of the U.S. population is married, a statistic that has remained steady over recent years but significantly down from the more than 70 percent marriage rate in 1960. Further, the analysis shows that marriage rates are increasingly becoming associated with socio-economic status, and the education gap in relation to marital status continues to widen.

Marriage is an evolving issue following the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015, which mandated marriage equality, whether between opposite sex or same sex, nationwide. Some could expect to see a surge in marriage rates across the U.S., but the national trend for marriages has remained stable ever since. Is this because of consistent errors on behalf of the U.S. Census Bureau and American Community Survey, or is there simply so significant change since the decision was made? 

According to a 2017 Gallup poll, 10.2 percent of LGBT adults are married to a same-sex spouse, a 2.3 percent increase from 2015. Furthermore, there was a dramatic decrease in same-sex partnerships in the two years following the ruling. It can be argued that LGBT marriages are contributing to the slowing decline in overall marriages in the United States, but an accurate count is hard to determine when the Census Bureau uses unclear rhetoric and questioning in its forms. 

The 2010 Census – the most recent on record – determined that the majority of same-sex married couples were recorded as opposite-sex couples because there was no distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Instead, a male head of household who had a spouse also identifying as male, the spouse had the option to choose “husband” or “wife.” As a result, it could be interpreted as an error on behalf of the household completing the census forms. But starting in 2020, census documents will include exclusive sections for both “opposite-sex” and “same-sex” spouses and unmarried partners to report a more accurate figure. 

In 2015, Pew Research analysis showed that the number of married same-sex couples in the United States in 2013 was likely overcounted, as admitted by the 2013 American Community Survey, a “mini census” performed each year to supplement the Census Bureau’s official report, which is published every decade. 



I will construct a complete dataset from the following data I will retrieve:

- 2010 Census data in relation to couples within the same household, both spousal and unmarried, same-sex and opposite-sex.

- American Community Survey data of same-sex spousal couples between 2015 and 2017.

- American Community Survey data of same-sex unmarried couples between 2015 and 2017.

- American Community Survey data of opposite-sex spousal couples between 2015 and 2017.

- American Community Survey data of opposite-sex unmarried couples between 2015 and 2017.

- Data from the Pew Research Center on marriage trends, and a potential “overcount” of same-sex couples in past censuses.

Using this data, I will
