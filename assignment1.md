# Not Down With Russia: New poll finds Americans growing hesitant of Putin's homeland 
### original story by Eli Yokley, Morning Consult

It was to no suprise that new data from Morning Consult found that Americans' impression of Russia has significantly declined since Special Counsel Robert Mueller has appointed to spearhead a probe to determine Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election in the U.S. 

The most surprising result of the Morning Consult/Politico poll was the drop in Republicans' view of Russia as an ally, going from 37 percent in May 2018 to twenty percent in the latest poll, conducted for four days in late March and early April 2018. and found twenty percent of registered voters 

The source was linked within the story, twice, and easily found and explained. The data and the way it was put together was easily read and understood, as they pinpointed the Russia Probe down to one question: is Russia an ally/friendly, or enemy/unfriendly? It gave a specific period of time to not the change, and an important moment in the Russia Probe -- the appointment of Robert Mueller -- to index a starting point. 

Because the story centers around a change in the minds of Republicans, I am left wondering if this would lead to more Republicans now thinking that Russia was involved in influencing the 2016 elections. It is a consistent denial from the White House, but I would be curious to see the change in this as well. 

Voters viewing Russia as "friendly" | March 2017 | April 2018
------------------------------------|------------|----------------
Republicans | 49%  | 28%
Democrats   | 28%  | 16%
