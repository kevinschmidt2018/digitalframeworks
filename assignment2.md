Dear Editor,

To assure the accuracy of my reporting, I am pulling all of my data from the American FactFinder chart “Demographic Characteristics for Occupied Housing Units, 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.” You can find the link at the top of this email. 

My most important piece of data in the story is in the section toward the bottom of the chart, “Year Householder Moved into Unit.” Comparing the “Moved in 2010 to 2014” section to the “Moved in 2000 to 2009” section, there is a distinct shift in the percentage of people who are moving to Washington, DC and whether they are homeowners or renters. Between 2000 and 2009, the time period that represents the second-largest relocation of residents (28.5 percent of DC households moved during that time, either from internal or external migration), 34.5 percent of them were homeowners, compared to 24.3 percent moved into a rented unit.  

Between 2010 to 2014, a time period that saw the largest amount of migration (41.4 percent of DC households moved during that time, either from internal or external migration), 21.9 percent of them were homeowners, and whopping 54.8 percent moved into a rented unit.  

Furthermore, the “Moved in 2015 or later” section shows that 9.4 percent of moved were into rented units, compared to 2.4 percent of moved into owned units. While this represents an overall smaller percentage of the greater population (the data only goes through 2016), the ratio of rented units over owned units comes close to 4:1, compared to roughly a 2.5:1 ratio in the 2010 to 2014 time period. This shows that this is an exponentially growing trend as the city grows as a whole. 

It is also important to note that Washington, DC holds a high 58.2 percent of residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher. 71.4 percent of residents with such educational attainment are homeowners, and 49.2 percent of residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher live in a rented unit. 

Based on this data, my story will revolve around how Washington, DC is attracting an influx of educated individuals during a growth spurt the city hasn’t seen, but the growth is not necessarily leading to a new generation of permanent Washington, DC residents.

Best,

Kevin Schmidt
