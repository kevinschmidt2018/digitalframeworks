A Tale of Two Other Trumps

When looking at the data, I was curious to see what entities would be identified when I narrowed the data set down to “salary.” Surprisingly, there were two other entities with the names that included “Trump” in the set: Christopher Trumpover of American Bridge 21st Century, and Rebecca Trump of the Capito for West Virginia campaign. These two individuals did not have any direct correlation to the President or the Trump Organization, but it was interesting to see how someone with such a familiar last name fared with income since Donald Trump assumed office. 

Rebecca Trump of Morgantown, West Virginia, received a steadier disbursement from the Capito for West Virginia entity. At the end of each month, Trump received a disbursement of 724.80. The description of payment, disbursement date, FEC election type and FEC election year were clearly listed to explain it was a net salary disbursement from a 2020 primary campaign. 

Christopher Trumpover was paid by American Bridge 21st Century, which is based out of Washington, D.C. The disbursements from the entity to Mr. Trumpover were not consistent and the reasoning for the disbursements were more difficult to determine. The disbursements range from 1293.14 up to 2865.01, and they usually come once around the middle of the month and again toward the end of the month. I would be curious to pursue this to see a repetitive fluctuation in the payments, and what the entity was specifically paying Trumpover for. 

The entity, American Bridge 21st Century, is a political action committee that “Holds Republicans Accountable,” according to its website. On the contrary, Rebecca Trump of West Virginia works for Shelley Moore Capito, a Senate Republican running for re-election in West Virginia. The data may not be groundbreaking, but it shows an interesting take on the other “Trumps” in the political sphere.
